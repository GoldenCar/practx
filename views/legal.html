                PracTx designed the fair use policy to keep our customers service at levels that are possible within an individuals 'health care provider' scope of practice and to minimise fraudulent practices.
                PracTx may make changes to the fair use policy at any time.
                PracTx may rely on the use of the policy where your use of PracTx is 'unreasonable' as defined below.
