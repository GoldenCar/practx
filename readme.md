Please follow these steps to run the project:
Note: We will use  yarn to install dependencies, because npm does not has feature to ignore node engine.

Make sure you use nodejs version-> 8.X.X

1. yarn install --ignore-engines
2. NODE_ENV='development'' TRIAL_PLANS='DSFASEF2342N4,DSFASEF2342N42,TRIALPLAN' node server


Now, Also make sure you have setup DB credentials in config.js in development section.
